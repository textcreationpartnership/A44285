         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Without furher preamble, the SyÅ¿tem and frame of this <hi>Mystery of iniquity</hi> (as the Context calls it) is thus; the foundation and root of ApoÅ¿taÅ¿ie is <hi>perÅ¿onal,</hi> in the graceleÅ¿s, Å¿infull hearts of Hypocrites: the Å¿uperÅ¿tructure and limbs are the concurrence of the generality of a Nation to Å¿peak that Language, and act that converÅ¿ation as Å¿uits to apoÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, or falling away, more or leÅ¿s; till at laÅ¿t it benear oeconomical and univerÅ¿al; that ChriÅ¿tendom (as they call it) be for the moÅ¿t quite cold in their affections, and corrupt in their very Principles as well as in their PractiÅ¿es. And though at a time, like an houÅ¿e on fire, Å¿ome peices falling, or a few Buckets powred on, do damp, and obÅ¿cure the flame for preÅ¿ent, yet anon it breaks out worÅ¿e, till the whole be pulled down: and thus it gets head again, by riÅ¿ing in Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Å¿hapes, and when it hath gone over all Å¿orts; then an old one riÅ¿eth up, as a new FaÅ¿hion: all which proceÅ¿s and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>ApostaÅ¿ie</hi> and <hi>AntichristianiÅ¿me,</hi> notwithÅ¿tanding Å¿ome impedings, or diÅ¿countenance, is Å¿enÅ¿ibly perceived by them that are Å¿piritual, <hi>Living Creatures</hi> (<hi>Revel.</hi> 4.) <hi>that have eyes as well within as without.</hi> TheÅ¿e can Å¿ee, that though all Roots of goodneÅ¿s be not kill'd, yet the BloÅ¿Å¿omes and young fruit of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46155:9"/>of the Trees are generally blaÅ¿ted. Though <hi>Autume</hi> Plants and Herbs be not as in <hi>Winter,</hi> altogether leaf-leÅ¿s, without all appearance, yet lifeleÅ¿s, without Å¿pirit and vigor.</p>

If this be true, thank PerÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, OppreÅ¿Å¿ions, Afflictions for it. But beÅ¿ides the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon CauÅ¿e of <hi>Apostates</hi> and <hi>Antichrists;</hi> 'tis the nature of the <hi>Beast,</hi> and property of the <hi>DiÅ¿eaÅ¿e,</hi> viz. <hi>Wicked men and Seducers grow worÅ¿e and worÅ¿e, deceiving and being deceived, till their folly and madneÅ¿s be made manifest to all men,</hi> (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9, 10, 11, 12, 13.) I Å¿ay, beÅ¿ides this common CauÅ¿e, that Å¿uch, in longer time, grow riper in their Å¿ins, there are Å¿pecial ReaÅ¿ons now nearer the end, afore <hi>Christs Appearance,</hi> to wit, now God changeth his hand, ever and anon, to truÅ¿t Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that have pofeÅ¿Å¿ed the GoÅ¿pel, with <hi>Liberty</hi> (Civil and Spiritual) a thing which for many Ages they have not known, and therefore are utterly unskilled to rightly uÅ¿e it. And from hence as men half-famiÅ¿hed coming to full Diet, they Å¿urfet and break out into Å¿piritual Scabs, and Botches. Their Liberty to the generality of them proves but as a Lightening afore Death; their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying but as the bright Glance and Glare of a Spark or Snuff before it goes out.

This our ApoÅ¿tle hints in the Context, when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts the <hi>TheÅ¿Å¿alonians not to be Å¿haken in minde.</hi> As we flee to Prayer for Å¿uccour againÅ¿t Å¿uch Å¿torms, Å¿o Faith is the hand of Prayer to lay hold and climb up into God's lap. And to cheriÅ¿h our Faith, and comfort thereby, the ApoÅ¿tle tells us in the Text and Context, that if, do the good party what they can, <hi>ApoÅ¿tacie</hi> and <hi>AntichriÅ¿tian impletie</hi> riÅ¿e yet higher and higher, come the worÅ¿t that can come, it Å¿hall not be long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ere ChriÅ¿t come. <hi>AcerbiÅ¿sima pati poÅ¿Å¿umus, modo breviÅ¿sima.</hi> We may endure <hi>Å¿harp</hi> things, if <hi>Å¿hort.</hi> If nothing elÅ¿e can take down the high appearance of <hi>ApoÅ¿tates</hi> and <hi>AntichriÅ¿ts,</hi> ChriÅ¿ts appearance Å¿hall. Then is their total ruine, and our perpetual reÅ¿tauration; and to triumph on earth (for a time) afore the Ultimate Glory; as we have it elÅ¿ewhere. That as when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would reÅ¿train Å¿everal rebellions of the IÅ¿raelites about to Å¿tone <hi>MoÅ¿es, Aaron,</hi> and other good men among them, <hi>The glory of the Lord</hi> appeared upon the Tabernacle, and aw'd and huÅ¿ht all: Å¿o Å¿hall it be in this. Therefore with Faith, and Hope, and perÅ¿onal purity, wait. Cannot we watch with ChriÅ¿t one hour? BleÅ¿Å¿ed are all they that Å¿tand ready wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for him with their loyns girt. <hi>Amen.</hi>
